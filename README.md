# About

At the conclusion of every year, Spotify generates a list of the most top-rated and popular songs over the course of that year. In this project, we are explored the commonality that exists between such songs and the factors based on why people tend to like such kind of songs over others. From a high-level overview, we investigated patterns in the audio features of the songs and tried to develop an inference regarding why do people stream these songs the most.

# Data

Our primary source of getting the relevant data is the website of Kaggle. Kaggle contains multiple datasets and repositories relating to specific information analysis. The data that has been leveraged to make consequent inferences based on predictive modeling and data visualization consists of Spotifyâ€™s Top Tracks of the year of 2018. The audio features for each song were extracted using the Spotify Web API and the Spotify Python library. Credit goes to Spotify for calculating the audio feature values.

When searching for a dataset, our lab team looked for a common interest among us. We discovered we all shared the common interest of music and the use of the popular streaming platform, Spotify. We used the free data science platform, Kaggle, to obtain a dataset. The datasets that we chose were the two most recent years of top Spotify data. The datasets can be obtained at these two locations: https://www.kaggle.com/nadintamer/top-spotify-tracks-of-2018 and https://www.kaggle.com/nadintamer/top-tracks-of-2017 .
