My name is Yash and I am graduate student majoring in Computer Science. I have my professional interests in Machine Learning, Data Mining and Computer Vision. Aside my academic stuff, I love watching soccer and boxing. I am really interested about the analysis in our final project in studying the top songs on Spotify for the last few years. Music's been a really great part of my life and I hope to give it back something from my side this time!
