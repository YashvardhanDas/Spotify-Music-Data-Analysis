The dataset we plan to explore is the Top Spotify Tracks of 2018 (https://www.kaggle.com/nadintamer/top-spotify-tracks-of-2018). Some of the main questions we plan to answer are how genre, liveliness, loudness, energy, tempo, and key affect danceability. We also may look at the top spotify datasets of previous years to analyze the differences in how these variables affect danceability as well. We also plan to analyze the similiarities in the variables among the top and bottom 40 songs in this dataset.
