Hello. My name is Antranig (Anto) Kechejian, and I am currently a senior at Boston University studying Economics with a minor in Statistics. I am an aspiring data analyst who is also a proud member of the Armenian community, a men's fashion enthusiast, and a competetive Super Smash Brothers Melee player. 

I am very excited to explore the spotify data set our group has selected, as music has played a key role in shaping who I am today.
