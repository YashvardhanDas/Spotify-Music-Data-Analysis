  My name is Claudia and I am a junior majoring in Mathematics. I also minor in Visual Arts. I am a singer/songwriter who plays the guitar, ukulele, and piano. 
  Because of my love for music, for our final project I hope to study the Top Spotify songs of different years. I would like to make different inferences about how style of music affects rankings and danceability.
