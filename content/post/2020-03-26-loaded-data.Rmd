We have loaded all of our data and created this preliminary plot of a song's energy versus danceability.
```{r example, echo = FALSE}
suppressMessages(source(here::here("load_and_clean_data.R")))
```

```{r plot, echo = FALSE}
top2018 %>% ggplot(aes(x = energy, y = danceability)) + 
  geom_point()
```
